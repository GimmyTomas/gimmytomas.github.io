    <p>Here are some of the things I do that are not directly related to science.</p>

    <h1>Pok&eacutemon videogames</h1>
    <p>The main series Pok&eacutemon games have been one of my lifelong companions. From 2020 onwards, most of my activity has revolved around speedrunning the games, which I sometimes stream on my <a href='https://www.twitch.tv/gimmytomas'>Twitch</a> channel. Videos of my completed speedruns are available on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp0JlgGFWmIluar1xZOzxMA'>YouTube</a>, while a complete list of personal bests can be found on my <a href='https://www.speedrun.com/users/Gimmy'>SRC profile</a> and on this <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10u6ksYDTgCE7p1wJ03miRgfbxAIa9pOWUlnqbCJLOFk/edit#gid=0'>spreadsheet</a>. I have showcased speedruns of Diamond/Pearl, Platinum and HeartGold/SoulSilver at three editions of GUF (an Italian speedrun marathon) and two editions of BSG (an international speedrun marathon held in the Netherlands).</p>
    <p>I particularly like the strategical aspect of Pok&eacutemon speedruns, including routing and research on the game mechanics. My favorite categories are the gen 4 glitched ones, with or without RNG manipulation. However, my best times are in Battle Frontier-related categories: in particular, I am a specialist of the Battle Factory. Before starting speedrunning, I have also extensively played Pok&eacutemon competitive battling.</p>

        <h1>Table football at Scuola Normale Superiore</h1>
        <p>Among the countless traditions at Scuola Normale Superiore, one of my favorites is an annual <a href='http://24ore.uz.sns.it/'>24-hour-long table football match</a>: mathematicians vs physicists. I have trained and played a lot with the goal of defeating the mathematicians, not always with the best results...</p>
        <p>The table football on which the match is held is called "Subotto" and is a really special one. I researched its historical origins, from its arrival to Normale in 2003, passing through all its technological additions and customizations, and up to recent times. The findings are summarized in a <a href='https://uz.sns.it/~Gimmy/subotto/storia.pdf'>document</a>, and additional material is available <a href='https://uz.sns.it/~Gimmy/subotto/'>here</a>.</p>
        
        <h1>A Choice 4 Life</h1>
        <p>I am involved in a <a href='https://www.achoiceforlife.it/'>A Choice 4 Life</a>, a project led by Giulio Deangeli that aims at providing high school students with enough information about university and jobs to make a conscious choice about their future. I have contributed to the 2021, 2022 and 2023 editions. In 2024, the project became a book, <a href='https://www.mondadoristore.it/La-facolta-di-scegliere-Giulio-Deangeli/eai978880477446/'>La facolt&agrave di scegliere</a>, to which I contributed with a short piece describing how I chose my path to university and beyond.</p>
