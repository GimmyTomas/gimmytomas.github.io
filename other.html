    <p>Here are some of the things I do that are not directly related to science.</p>

    <h1>Outdoor activities</h1>
    
    <p><img src="hawaii-images/day-5/lava-river-dusk.jpeg" alt="K&imacr;lauea"></p>
    <h2>Hiking</h2>
    <p>I really love exploring natural areas! These include mountains, islands, volcanoes, National Parks, as well as more niche locations.</p>
    
    <p>Some of my most recent trips include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="hawaii.html" target="_self">Big Island</a> in Hawai&#699;i, in August 2025 (click on the link for a diary of the trip!);</li>
        <li>Mt. Rainier, Mt. St. Helens and Hanford site, in November 2024;</li>
        <li>The Canadian Rockies (Banff, Yoho, Jasper) and Vancouver Island, in August 2024;</li>
        <li>Sydney, the Blue Mountains and Kangaroo Island, in November and December 2023.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><img src="images/astro-runners.jpeg" alt="Astro runners"></p>
    <h2>Running</h2>
    <p>After moving to Princeton in September 2024, I became a runner! My colleague astrophysicists convinced me to join the <a href="https://results.raceroster.com/v2/en-US/results/uys2yg7sxphjwgy4/results">2024 Princeton Half Marathon</a>. Even though it was only 5 weeks after I had started running, I completed it much faster than I expected!</p>
    
    <p>I continued running during the year, taking part in a few more races, such as the <a href="https://elitefeats.com/race-results/?id=23963">2024 Princeton Turkey Trot (5k)</a>, the <a href="https://my.raceresult.com/316860/results#1_61E9DE">IAS Woods Winter Wonder Run 2024 (6k)</a>, and the legendary <a href="https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/MAYDAY/mayday25.html">Fred Almgren Memorial "Mayday" Relay Race</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Hopefully I will step up my training and improve my times over the years.</p>

    <h2>Pok&eacutemon videogames</h2>
    <p>The main series Pok&eacutemon games have been one of my lifelong companions. From 2020 onwards, most of my activity has revolved around speedrunning the games, which I sometimes stream on my <a href='https://www.twitch.tv/gimmytomas'>Twitch</a> channel (although I haven't really done much from September 2024 onwards...). Videos of my completed speedruns are available on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp0JlgGFWmIluar1xZOzxMA'>YouTube</a>, while a complete list of personal bests can be found on my <a href='https://www.speedrun.com/users/Gimmy'>SRC profile</a> and on this <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10u6ksYDTgCE7p1wJ03miRgfbxAIa9pOWUlnqbCJLOFk/edit#gid=0'>spreadsheet</a>. I have showcased speedruns of Diamond/Pearl, Platinum and HeartGold/SoulSilver at three editions of GUF (an Italian speedrun marathon) and two editions of BSG (an international speedrun marathon held in the Netherlands).</p>
    <p>I particularly like the strategical aspect of Pok&eacutemon speedruns, including routing and research on the game mechanics. My favorite categories are the gen 4 glitched ones, with or without RNG manipulation. However, my best times are in Battle Frontier-related categories: in particular, I am a specialist of the Battle Factory. Before starting speedrunning, I have also extensively played Pok&eacutemon competitive battling.</p>

    <h2>Table football at Scuola Normale Superiore</h2>
    <p>Among the countless traditions at Scuola Normale Superiore, one of my favorites is an annual <a href='http://24ore.uz.sns.it/'>24-hour-long table football match</a>: mathematicians vs physicists. I have trained and played a lot with the goal of defeating the mathematicians, not always with the best results...</p>
    <p>The table football on which the match is held is called "Subotto" and is a really special one. I researched its historical origins, from its arrival to Normale in 2003, passing through all its technological additions and customizations, and up to recent times. The findings are summarized in a <a href='https://uz.sns.it/~Gimmy/subotto/storia.pdf'>document</a>, and additional material is available <a href='https://uz.sns.it/~Gimmy/subotto/'>here</a>.</p>

    <h1>More outreach</h1>
    <h2>A Choice 4 Life</h2>
    <p>I am involved in a <a href='https://www.achoiceforlife.it/'>A Choice 4 Life</a>, a project led by Giulio Deangeli that aims at providing high school students with enough information about university and jobs to make a conscious choice about their future. I have contributed to the 2021, 2022 and 2023 editions. In 2024, the project became a book, <a href='https://www.mondadoristore.it/La-facolta-di-scegliere-Giulio-Deangeli/eai978880477446/'>La facolt&agrave di scegliere</a>, to which I contributed with a short piece describing how I chose my path to university and beyond.</p>
